# SKFCMS - A Django Project For Developing An Ecommerce System
I started this project for teaching my students Django. As I follow project based approach I started teaching them developing an ecommerce web application with Django.

SKF stands for Sabuj, Kamrul and Firoz. CMS does not literally mean a content management system here. But I have plan to improve it further to make it more like a CMS. We needed a name and SKF came to my my promptly.

As this project is still in it's childhood, you cannot just run it and go to the `http://localhost:8000` and expect to see a complete web application. You need to look at `urls.py` to browse through different sections of the application. We will add them gradually. You should remember that this project is initially for educational purpose with a good intention of extending it to production level. So, you cannot expect plug-and-play behavior from it.

You may see a bit unfamiliar naming convention here. With many years of experience in Python and Django I realized that it is better to add different suffix to different things in Django. For example, at the end of every app name root directory you will see `_app` appended to them. The root folder of `settings.py` contains `_project` at the end of it. The custom python modules that I/we make here has `_module` appended to them. Remember, modules are independent components that has no dependency on Django.

You will also see that the teaching pattern here is also unconventional. I do not believe in going through a fixed syllabus. At the first class I listen to their current and previous skills and give them little tasks to test them. After that I create a course plan that best suits them. Some classes are theory heavy and some classes are code heavy. Also, all the code practiced in a class is not pushed to this repository. For examples, when I see that they have some weakness in basic python or any other intermediate or advanced area, I train them up to shun those areas - code for those things are not usually present in the repository.

## Interested In Taking Python/Django Training?
If you live in Dhaka, Bangladesh you can take training being present physically in our small training center.

If you live in any other country or in any other place in Bangladesh, you can take live online training from me.

We also have other courses here along with Python and Django. Send me an email or directly call my cell number.
